# Intelligent AI System for Pest and Disease Risk Assessment

The system will:  
1. Trigger the **Environmental & Crop Data Analysis Agent**  
2. Identify potential threats with the **Pest & Disease Risk Detection Agent**  
3. Deliver actionable risk alerts and **preventive care recommendations** via the **Risk Alert & Advisory Assistant**

## Novelty & Uniqueness

- **Multi-Agent AI Framework:** Ensures structured, sequential processing of complex agricultural data.  
- **Non-Chemical Recommendations:** Focuses on **sustainable farming** by avoiding chemical interventions.  
- **Real-Time Knowledge Retrieval:** Combines vector database retrieval with **RAG** for the most relevant advisory output.  
- **Integration with IBM watsonx.ai & Langflow:** Leverages enterprise-grade AI models and multi-agent orchestration.
